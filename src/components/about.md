## What's Flowmodoro?

Flowmodoro is a productivity technique inspired by the widely known Pomodoro technique. However, unlike Pomodoro, Flowmodoro allows you to take advantage of the flow state to complete your to-do list of the day.

## How does it work?

Flowmodoro works as a timer instead of a countdown. And letting you have the choice to decide when you should take a break. For example, let’s say you worked for 25 minutes and you finished one of your tasks or you are struggling to focus, then you can take a 5-minute break. This improves the Pomodoro method in two areas.
First, you aren’t obligated to work for a pre-defined amount of time, and therefore it’s up to you when to finish a working session, allowing you to take advantage of getting on the flow.
Second, it feels more like a reward and/or a challenge to get more stuff done while getting a better break.

And if you are familiar with the Pomodoro technique, you probably have found the 25/5 ratio somehow familiar, and this is because it’s the same, but not fixable to a certain amount of minutes.
